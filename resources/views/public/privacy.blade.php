                        communicate with your browser and receive your IP address. They may also use other technologies,
                        including cookies and web beacons, to collect data and analyze the performance of their advertisements.
                        This allows the ads we display to be more relevant and interesting to you. We do not provide personal
                        information to advertisers when you view, click, or interact with a targeted ad. However, if you
                        view, click, or interact with a targeted ad, the responsible advertisers and ad servers may assume
                        that you have certain characteristics that match their intended audience. By viewing, clicking, or
                        interacting with a targeted ad, you acknowledge and consent to ad servers recording such assumptions
                        about you. Our privacy policy does not apply to the ad servers that display advertisements on our
                        Site. Please consult their respective privacy policies for more information.</p>
