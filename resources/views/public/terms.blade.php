<li>Shipping Documents a.

All Bills of Lading are NON-NEGOTIABLE. BCO Power, retains the right to VOID all rate quotes and/or VOID all obligations to make any payments to a carrier/forwarder/NVOCC relating to a shipment in which customer utilizes any Bill of Lading not authorized or issued by the carrier/forwarder/NVOCC or BCO Power, or alteration of said BOL or tendering of shipments to any carrier other than that designated by BCO Power . In the event customer uses unauthorized BOL, an administrative charge of $50 may apply. b. After freight charges are paid and within one week, reasonable restrictions may apply, following Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) Express Release Bill of Lading will be e-mailed to the consigner. Mail or facsimile copies are available upon request. Express Release means that consignee does not have to provide any Bill of Lading originals in order to recover cargo at the destination. The Bill of Lading will show shipments routing and contact details of the destination receiving station. Consignee may contact the receiving station on the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). To avoid mistakes we suggest provide a copy of the Bill of Lading and let the destination receiving station know how to reach consignee once freight is available for the release. c. Copy of express release Bill of Lading via e-mail is free. d. Facsimile copies by request may incur an additional fee. e.

In this event consignee must provide a set of original Bills of Lading to recover the cargo at the destination, we will assess an express mail charge of $150 USD. BCO Power will not be responsible for any demurrage or other charges connected to delays in the release and you hereby release us from liability with respect to such delays.

Return check fee is $50. </li>

<li>Transit/Sailing Time a. No shipments have a Guaranteed Transit time. All estimated time of arrivals (ETA's) are estimates only. There is no “Money-back Guarantee” policy. Please allow extra time beyond the estimated transit for the shipment in the event of any delays. For Sea Freight transit/sailing time and vessel schedule provided in shipment details is not precise. Estimate Time of Departure (ETD) and Estimate Time of Arrival (ETA) cannot guarantee a specific transit time. b. Any reference to “GUARANTEED “on BCO Power, website is related to available capacity on quoted cargo vessel and any association to transit time is not express or implied. c. Shipments that require more than Packing List and Commercial Invoice may require more transit time. d. OCEAN-RAIL-TRUCK SHIPMENTS: If the shipping documents indicate that a port of discharge is different from the final destination (Place of Delivery by Carrier), then cargo will discharge first at the port of discharge and continue traveling to its final destination. Estimate Time of Arrival (ETA) on customer's Bill of Lading (BOL) for such shipments is to the first port of discharge, NOT TO THE FINAL DESTINATION. Arrival to the final destination requires additional time. For more precise ETA to the FINAL DESTINATION contact customer's destination agent indicated in customer's BOL in 10-15 days after ETA to the port of discharge for the transshipment. e. If for any reason destination terminal will not contact consignee and/or notify party after Estimate Time of Arrival (ETA) it is strongly recommended to notify the destination terminal indicated within the ‘FOR DELIVERY/PICKUP PLEASE APPLY TO' field of customer's Bill of Lading in few days after the ETA. It will insure that customers are prepared for recovery of customer's freight and avoid possible storage or demurrage charges. f. NOTICE: The final destination station may only be notified a few days prior to customer's cargo's arrival. We recommend that customer contact customer's destination agent, send them a copy of customer's express release Bill of Lading, confirm the consignee's contact info, and wait for an arrival notice from them. </li>
